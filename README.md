# Stochastic-Models-for-Pricing-Futures-on-WTI-Crude-Oil
This repository contains the empirical study (made in python) of four stochastic models for WTI crude oil futures pricing. The goal is to estimate model parameters and evaluate predictive performance using real market data.

# ðŸ“ˆ Stochastic Models for Pricing WTI Futures

This project implements four **closed-form stochastic models** to price **futures contracts on WTI crude oil**, with both in-sample estimation and out-of-sample evaluation. The models are applied on real data, and include error diagnostics and maturity-stratified performance analysis.

> ðŸŽ“ This work is part of a Master's Thesis in Finance & Banking at the **University of Piraeus**, titled:  
> **"Stochastic Models for Pricing Futures on WTI Crude Oil"**

## ðŸ“š Models Included

| Model | Name | Description | Parameters |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | **Gabillon (GBM)** | Geometric Brownian Motion with convenience yield | 1 (Î´) |
| 2 | **Schwartz (OU)** | Mean-reverting log process | 3 (Î¸, Î±, Ïƒ) |
| 3 | **Aba Oud & Goard â€“ Bessel** | Modified square-root diffusion | 2 (a, Ïƒ) |
| 4 | **Aba Oud & Goard â€“ CIR** | Modified CIR with Â¾ volatility | 3 (a, b, Ïƒ) |

Each model has a **closed-form futures price formula** and is estimated using least-squares minimization against observed prices.
