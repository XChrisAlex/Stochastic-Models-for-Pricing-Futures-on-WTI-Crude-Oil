# Stochastic-Models-for-Pricing-Futures-on-WTI-Crude-Oil
This repository contains the empirical study (made in python) of four stochastic models for WTI crude oil futures pricing. The goal is to estimate model parameters and evaluate predictive performance using real market data.

# ðŸ“ˆ Stochastic Models for Pricing WTI Futures

This project implements four **closed-form stochastic models** to price **futures contracts on WTI crude oil**, with both in-sample estimation and out-of-sample evaluation. The models are applied on real data, and include error diagnostics and maturity-stratified performance analysis.

> ðŸŽ“ This work is part of a Master's Thesis in Finance & Banking at the **University of Piraeus**, titled:  
> **"Stochastic Models for Pricing Futures on WTI Crude Oil"**

## ðŸ“š Models Included

| Model | Description | SDE | Parameters |
|-------|-------------|-----|------------|
| **1. GBM (Gabillon)** | Geometric Brownian Motion | \\( dS = \\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t \\) | \\( \\delta \\) |
| **2. OU (Schwartz)** | Mean-reverting log process | \\( dS = \\theta(\\mu - \\ln S) dt + \\sigma S dW_t \\) | \\( \\theta, \\alpha, \\sigma \\) |
| **3. Modified Bessel (Aba Oud & Goard)** | Square-root model with nonlinear volatility | \\( dS = a\\sqrt{S}dt + \\sigma S^{3/4} dW_t \\) | \\( a, \\sigma \\) |
| **4. Modified CIR (Aba Oud & Goard)** | CIR-style drift with 3/4 volatility | \\( dS = (a\\sqrt{S} + bS)dt + \\sigma S^{3/4} dW_t \\) | \\( a, b, \\sigma \\) |

Each model provides an **analytical expression** for futures prices, assuming no-arbitrage and deterministic interest rates.
